# EasyTer

**A Windows terminal that renders connected (shaped) Arabic correctly** — plus
tabs, split panes, themes, search, an embedded editor, and a Python plugin API.

## Screenshots

Connected, shaped Arabic in a real terminal session — correct letter joining,
diacritics, bidirectional layout, and Arabic-Indic numbers in the right order:

The same correct Arabic in the built-in editor (syntax highlighting + line numbers):

## Why

Mainstream Windows terminals (Windows Terminal, and GPU terminals like kitty and
Alacritty) do **not** join Arabic letters or apply the bidirectional algorithm, so
Arabic comes out disconnected and mis-ordered. EasyTer renders every line through
Qt's `QTextLayout`, which embeds HarfBuzz shaping and the Unicode BiDi algorithm
(UAX #9) — the same engine native Linux terminals hand-roll. The result is
properly **connected Arabic**, even inside interactive programs.

It is built on a real pseudo-console (`pywinpty` / ConPTY) running a VT screen
emulator (`pyte`), so it runs real interactive programs (PowerShell, cmd, Git Bash,
WSL, Claude Code, vim, …).

## Features

- **Connected Arabic** via QTextLayout (HarfBuzz shaping + UAX #9 BiDi).
- **Tabs** and **split panes** (side-by-side / top-bottom), draggable dividers, pane
  **zoom**, **broadcast input** to all panes, and **reopen the last closed tab**.
- **New tabs/splits open in the current directory** (OSC 7 / 9;9), and tabs show
  **dynamic titles** that follow the working directory.
- **Command blocks** (OSC 133 shell integration): a green/red gutter bar marks each
  command's success/failure, and `Ctrl+Shift+↑/↓` jumps between commands.
- **Themes** — 15+ built-in (Dracula, Nord, Tokyo Night, Gruvbox, Catppuccin, One
  Dark, Monokai, Solarized, Kali Dark, …) plus full UI theming, free ANSI color
  editing, adjustable opacity, and an optional **background image**.
- **Search** (`Ctrl+F`) over the logical text, so Arabic matches correctly.
- **Embedded editor** pane with syntax highlighting and line numbers (handles large
  files efficiently).
- **Clickable links** (`Ctrl`+click), **multiple cursor styles**, **paste protection**
  + bracketed paste, and **OSC 52 clipboard** (programs can set the clipboard).
- **Desktop notification** when a long command finishes while EasyTer is in the
  background.
- **Quake-style global hotkey** (`Ctrl+Alt+`​`) to summon/hide EasyTer from anywhere.
- **Python plugin API** — keybindings, commands, themes, event hooks, status
  segments (see `examples/init.py`).
- **Shell auto-detect** (PowerShell, cmd, Git Bash, WSL), **session save/restore**,
  configurable scrollback, fast throttled rendering.
- **Claude mode** — automatic BiDi handling for Claude Code's full-screen UI. It
  auto-enables **only when Claude itself is running**, so other alternate-screen
  programs (`git diff` in `less`, `vim`, `man`, `htop`) keep correct native BiDi
  instead of being reshaped — which previously shredded their Arabic. `F2` still
  toggles it manually for any tool that pre-reverses Arabic.
- Bilingual UI: **English (default)** and Arabic. Local-first, **no telemetry**.

## Requirements

- **Windows 10 or 11** (EasyTer uses ConPTY, which is Windows-only).
- **Python 3.10–3.14.** Install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  and tick **"Add python.exe to PATH"** during setup.
- **Python packages:** `PySide6` (≥ 6.5), `pywinpty` (≥ 3.0.5), `pyte`, `wcwidth`.
  These are installed for you by `install.bat` (or `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
  `pywinpty` 3.0.5 ships wheels for Python 3.10–3.14, so no source build is needed.

EasyTer checks these on startup: if Python is too old or a package is missing, it
shows a message box telling you exactly what to install instead of failing silently.

## Install

Double-click **`install.bat`**. It works from any folder: it shows where EasyTer
is, warns you if that's a system/temporary folder, lets you install here or
relocate to `C:\EasyTer` (recommended), then installs the dependencies. Or do it
manually from the project folder:

```sh
cd path\to\EasyTer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```sh
pythonw EasyTer.py
```

Or double-click `EasyTer.vbs` (no console window), or run `run.bat`.

## Language

The UI is English by default. To switch to Arabic: **Settings (`Ctrl+,`) → Language →
العربية**, then restart EasyTer.
